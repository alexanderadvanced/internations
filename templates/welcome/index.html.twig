    <h1>Hi, Guys!</h1>
    <p>
        Here is the sample application, which I've made by <a href="/backend-developer-coding-task.pdf" target="_blank">your tech-task.</a><br>
        Please, note, that I used the simplest way to do it, but this is how it should be done, on my opinion.<br>
        I believe that good developer should write less code, because:<br><br>

        1. Almost everything is already written, fixed, covered by tests and located on GitHub.<br>
        2. Existing libs pretty always has some documentation.<br>
        Write code from the scratch â€” is even easy, but it always will lead us to bugs, uncovered code, leak of documentation.<br><br>

        So I used Symfony6 for the base, EasyAdmin for CRUD, ApiPlatform for the API.<br>
        Almost everything was generated by the cli-commands, so I am sure that you aware of structure of files and code.<br><br>

        I welcome you to the <a href="{{ path('admin') }}">Admin panel</a> where you can create users, groups, attach user to groups<br>
        and don't forget to delete group with users, it should fire a red message!<br><br>

        Also, this is very simple app, so the UML diagram are very simple and looks empty:<br>
        <img src="/uml.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="300">
    </p>
</div>
